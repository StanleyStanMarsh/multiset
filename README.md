# Multiset

This repository contains a C++ program that implements the concept of multisets. 

## Description

The program generates a [universe](https://github.com/StanleyStanMarsh/multiset/blob/main/Universe.h) using Gray codes and creates [multisets](https://github.com/StanleyStanMarsh/multiset/blob/main/Multiset.h) based on this universe. The user can either input the multisets automatically or manually. 

The program supports various operations on sets, including:
- Complement: computes the complement of a set
- Union: computes the union of two sets
- Intersection: computes the intersection of two sets
- Difference: computes the difference between two sets
- Symmetric Difference: computes the symmetric difference between two sets
- Arithmetic Sum: computes the sum of two sets
- Arithmetic Difference: computes the difference between two sets
- Multiplication: computes the multiplication of two sets
- Division: computes the division of two sets

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.
3. Build and run the program.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the multisets and perform the desired operations.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- C++ development environment
